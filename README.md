Simple Calculator made with HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Description

This is a mini-project that can do basic operations. I modeled the look of the calculator after iOS stock calculator application.

Operations include:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division

## Common Misinputs

During testing, I noticed that if I had clicked on a button, and then pressed the "Enter" key after, each press of the "Enter" key would result in the click event listener to fire on that button, resulting in an input. This can cause additional inputs being added to the operands or for additional presses of the last operation pressed, resulting in the button staying active even though the correct answer is displayed. This happens because the "Enter" key causes the operation to be evaulated (and the answer to be displayed) but also causes the operation to be presssed again. If anyone knows how this can be prevented, please submit an issue, pull request, or reach me at <john.c.soliven@gmail.com>!

## What's Next

I had fun making this project, but I can definitely clean up my code some more.

Also, Chrome DevTools mobile resolution emulation, I quickly found out, is not accurate. Running the live demo of the calculator on my iPhone 11 showed a completely different version than what the DevTools showed me with divs misplaced everywhere. I tried to fix as much as I can without using a million commits on this repo, but this is definitely something that I will come back to in the future.
