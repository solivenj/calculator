Simple Calculator made with HTML, CSS, and JS.

[Live Demo](https://jcsoliven.com/calculator)

## Description

This is a mini-project that can do basic operations. I modeled the look of the calculator after iOS stock calculator application.

Operations include:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division

## Features

- Keyboard Support
- Negative Numbers
- Decimals

## What's Next

I had fun making this project, but I can definitely clean up my code some more.

I want the live demo to be responsive and essentially look as though there is an emulated iPhone running the calculator application on desktop-size viewports, but also look as if the calculator app is being run on the browser and fit the edges of the calculator to the mobile window.
